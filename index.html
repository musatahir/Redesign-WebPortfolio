        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>For as long as I can remember, the <a href="https://www.bilalmasjid.com/AboutUs/Default.aspx"
                target="_blank">Bilal Masjid website</a> has looked dated,
            lacking modern usability features. The site's navigation is cluttered and its responsivity is nonexistent,
            making it cumbersome for users on different devices.
            Given these issues, I decided to focus on this webpage and aimed to give its
            about section a modern, clean, and responsive design while ensuring better
            accessibility for all users.
        </p>

    <!-- Problem Identification Section -->
    <section id="problem-identification">
        <h2>Problem Identification</h2>

        <img class="centered-img" src="images/bilal-website.jpg" alt="picture of bilal website home page">


        <p>For this project, I focused on redesigning the "About Us" webpage specifically due to its role as a key entry
            point for
            users unfamiliar with the mosque. The changes on this core webpage can serve as a model for improvements
            across the website as a whole. Despite having limited content, the webpage divides the "About Us" section
            into two subsections: About Us and History. Below are the main problems I identified about the webpage:</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Usability Principle</th>
                    <th>Problem</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <!-- Efficiency -->
                <tr>
                    <td>Efficiency</td>
                    <td>
                        - Users must sift through too many repeated categories (including sidebar), reducing
                        efficiency.<br>
                        - Content like “About Us > History” requires multiple clicks as well as actions like signing up
                        for the email list.<br>
                        - Prayer times are placed in the sidebar instead of center stage.<br>
                        - Site isn’t responsive on mobile — zooming is required.
                    </td>
                </tr>

                <!-- Learnability -->
                <tr>
                    <td>Learnability</td>
                    <td>
                        - Buttons lack visual clarity; some don’t look clickable (e.g., donation button).<br>
                        - No strong visual hierarchy — headings blend into body text.<br>
                        - Menu items like “Information” are vague and unhelpful.<br>
                        - No clear call-to-action for donating or signing up that is an obvious button for users
                    </td>
                </tr>

                <!-- Memorability -->
                <tr>
                    <td>Memorability</td>
                    <td>
                        - Poor content structure makes it hard to re-find info.<br>
                        - No hover effects or dropdowns as memory aids.<br>
                        - Terms like “Zakat” and “Donations” used inconsistently.<br>
                        - Missing recognizable icons (e.g., no search magnifying glass). <br>
                        - Overall the structure is overwhelming, making it difficult to remember where to find relevant
                        information. <br>
                    </td>
                </tr>

                    <td>Conceptual Model</td>
                    <td>
                        - No dropdowns for smaller screens, hover states, or standard UI conventions.<br>
                        - Sections are labeled inconsistently — some pages feel unrelated.<br>
                        - On mobile, zoom is required — no adaptive layout.
                    </td>
                </tr>

                <!-- Accessibility -->

                    <td>
                        - 9 errors (e.g., missing alt text, bad HTML structure, unlabeled form elements).<br>
                        - 37 low contrast issues — text hard to read for some users.<br>
                        - 10 alerts — improper headings and missing page regions.<br>
                        - No ARIA labels for interactive elements like search bars and buttons.<br>
                        - Screen reader users can’t properly interact due to missing labels and poor structure.
                    </td>

    <!-- Redesign Process Section -->
    <section id="redesign-process">
        <h2>Redesign Process</h2>
        <p>The redesign aimed to create a clean, accessible, and mobile-friendly webpage by merging the History and
            About Us subsections into a single unified About Us page. To visualize the redesign and ensure consistency,
            I created detailed mockups and a comprehensive design style
            guide in Figma. The guide included typography standards, button styles, color palettes, and responsive
            layouts. Mockups were designed for mobile, tablet, and desktop views to validate the responsive design
            before implementation.

        <!-- Usability Improvements -->
        <h3>How the Redesign Addresses Usability Issues & Other Key Improvements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Streamlined Navigation:</strong> Implemented intuitive mobile navigation by grouping related
                items in a
                hamburger menu for mobile. Simplified content architecture by merging related sections (e.g., "About Us"
                and "History"). Eliminated redundant sidebar elements to
                reduce visual clutter.</li>

            <li><strong>Responsive and Mobile-Friendly Design:</strong> Adopted a mobile-first approach that ensures
                optimal viewing across all devices. Increased tap target sizes and improved typography for mobile
                readability. Pages now fluidly adapt to different screen dimensions through responsive collapsing and
                realignment.</li>

            <li><strong>Improved Visual and Button Design:</strong> Designed consistent, interactive buttons with hover
                states. Established clear visual hierarchy through thoughtful typography (size, weight, spacing) and
                strategic placement of call to action buttons. Note that the action buttons appear next to search bar in
                expanded
                dropdown for mobile to avoid overwhelming user.</li>

            <li><strong>Modern and Predictable UI Patterns:</strong> Incorporated contemporary conventions like
                intuitive dropdown menus. Removed ambiguous or duplicate labels (e.g, zakat vs donations)
            </li>

            <li><strong>Enhanced Interactivity:</strong> Introduced dynamic UI elements such as year-selector buttons to
                allow users to interact with time-based content. This improves engagement and reduces friction when
                navigating historical or seasonal information.</li>

            <li><strong>Footer Optimization for Efficiency:</strong> Added a persistent footer with key actions like
                email subscription, reducing the need for users to click through multiple pages (e.g., “Subscribe”
                section) just to join the mailing list. This streamlines task flow and supports faster interaction for
                repeat users.</li>


        </ul>

        <h3>How the Redesign Addresses Accessibility Issues</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Alt Text:</strong> Added comprehensive alternative text for all
                meaningful images.</li>

            <li><strong>High Contrast and Readability:</strong> Deployed WCAG compliant color combinations (dark
                greens against white) to maximize text legibility and visual comfort.</li>

            <li><strong>ARIA Labeling and Accessibility Enhancements:</strong> Enhanced interactive components (buttons,
                form fields) with appropriate ARIA attributes for better screen reader interpretation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Responsive Website</h2>
        <p>The redesigned website has been tested for responsiveness and accessibility across various devices and screen
            sizes.

        </p>

        <p> <br>
            To demonstrate responsive behavior, I recorded screen captures of the site on three different screen sizes:
            desktop, tablet, and mobile. These recordings show how layout and functionality adapt smoothly across
            devices. Additionally, I conducted a WebAIM WAVE accessibility report to ensure the site meets WCAG.

    <section id="reflection">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>This project improved my understanding of responsive design principles and the importance of accessibility in
            designing web pages. From a technical standpoint, CSS Flexbox and Grid, along with media queries and tools
            like clamp(), proved tremendously useful. </p>
